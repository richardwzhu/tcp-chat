# Usage Guide

## Running the Server

To start the server, navigate to the directory containing the compiled executables and run:

```bash
./server
```

## Running the Client

To start a client that connects to the server, use:

```bash
./client
```

## Client-Server Interaction

* Once the client is started, it will connect to the server and send a predefined message.
* The server will respond, and the client will display the server's response.
